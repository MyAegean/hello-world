## About MyAegean


<p>The idea of <em>"my Aegean"</em> originated in 2002 with a group of students from the University of the Aegean. The aim of this initiative was to create a network portal for the whole of the Aegean University community by utilising any available technology.<br>Our aspiration is to create <strong>a vehicle which will encourage and promote direct, collective and qualitative communication and information exchange, without geographical restrictions, among all members of the Aegean community</strong> (students, academic and research staff, as well as administrative, technical or other personnel). <em>myAegean</em> is to serve as a common point of reference, as a scheme which will stimulate and facilitate interaction among all the members of the university.</p>

### Web portal | e-Magazine | Forum | Activities | Albums & Media repositories

<p>The 16 departments of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aegean.gr/" data-href="http://www.aegean.gr/">University of the Aegean</a> are situated on six islands of the Archipelago, which is a unique feature of this Institution. Accordingly, communication and interaction among the members of all departments is not an easy venture. <strong>Registration to this network portal is free of charge and easy to accomplish. By registering, one will have the opportunity to chat with other members, share one's views, be informed, as well as provide information.</strong> The initial design of the portal was based on three axes: <strong>Information</strong>, <strong>Entertainment</strong>, and <strong>Communication</strong>. These aspects can be promoted and enhanced through a range of tools and facilities provided to the user. The network node <a target="_blank" href="http://my.aegean.gr/" data-href="http://my.aegean.gr/">my.aegean.gr</a> as well as the individual websites which have also been developed ( <a target="_blank" href="http://my.aegean.gr/radio" data-href="http://my.aegean.gr/radio"><em>my.aegean.gr/radio</em></a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://my.aegean.gr/politistiki" data-href="http://my.aegean.gr/politistiki"><em>my.aegean.gr/politistiki</em></a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://my.aegean.gr/web" data-href="http://my.aegean.gr/web"><em>my.aegean.gr/web</em></a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://my.aegean.gr/gallery" data-href="http://my.aegean.gr/gallery"><em>my.aegean.gr/gallery</em></a><em> e.t.c. </em>) are in the responsibility of students from all departments. Any students who wish to join our team, as well as any suggestions are most welcome!</p><p name="2808" class="graf--p"><a id="2808"></a>It is worth noting that, with time, this network portal has grown to provide a firm ground for action, and numerous activities have been fostered and nurtured through the constructive exchange of ideas and information. At the same time, it has significantly contributed to the projection of the University, thus making it more widely known to the public. It has gradually come to <strong>act as a springboard for creative collaboration and exchange of ideas among a great number of people both within and outside the University with the aim of promoting culture and encouraging a qualitative, fruitful means of interaction</strong>.</p>


### Project: "eXperience"


<p>Among several activities and events, the <a target="_blank" href="http://my.aegean.gr/web/myaegean-experience.html" data-href="http://my.aegean.gr/web/myaegean-experience.html">project “eXperience”</a> is related to develop stronger “afk” relationships of the students and people around the six university units on the Aegean Sea. It started on 2007 as a couch-surfing style experience, in cooperation of student teams between islands, organizing walks in the nature, talks and other types of events, involving the participation of students from different than the “host” island/unit. By submitting open calls and volunteering on the entire scheme of these initiatives, this drives the thirst for exploration of greek nature as well as exchanging experiences from the different cities of the Archipelago and socializing people and ideas.</p>

Events, exhibitions, talks, open discussions and other parallel activities take place over the Aegean Sea, and a lot of passion is shared among students and other people, who collaborate online and offline, and share great experiences!
